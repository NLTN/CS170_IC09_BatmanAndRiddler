IC09_BatmanAndRiddler

Holy digits Batman!  The Riddler is planning his next caper somewhere on Pennsylvania Avenue.  In his usual sporting fashion, the Riddler has left the address in the form of a puzzle.  The address on Pennsylvania is a four-digit number where all the following criteria are true:

All four digits are different
The digit in the thousands place is three times the digit in the tens place
The number is odd
The sum of all four digits == 27
Write a Java console application that uses a single loop to figure out the address (4-digit number) where the Riddler intends to strike.  Display the address as "The Riddler intends to strike #### Pennsylvania Avenue."
